        "E1 277o Reinforcement Learning (3:1) \nCourse Instructor \nProf. Shalabh Bhatnagar, CSA \n \nCourse Description \nReinforcement learning refers to a class of techniques that combine aspects of optimal control, simulation/data driven \noptimization, and approximation methods for problems of dynamic decision making under uncertainty when the model \nof the underlying system and its processes is unknown. A large portion of the algorithms and techniques used here are \nmodel-free in nature and as a result need no knowledge of the system dynamics and protocols used. Reinforcement \nLearning thus finds applications in several diverse areas such as Adaptive Control, Signal Processing, Manufacturing, \nCommunication and Wireless Networks, Autonomous Systems and Data Mining. \nThe objective of this course will be to provide both a rigorous foundation in Reinforcement Learning through the various \ntools, techniques and algorithms used as well as to cover the state-of-the-art algorithms in Deep Reinforcement Learning \ninvolving simulation-based neural network methods. \nSyllabus \nIntroduction to Reinforcement Learning, Multi-armed bandits, Markov decision processes, Dynamic Programming - \nValue and Policy Iteration Methods, Model-Free Learning Approaches, Monte-Carlo Methods, Temporal Difference \nLearning, Q-learning, SARSA, Double Q-learning, Value Function Approximation Methods - TD Learning with Linear \nFunction Approximation, Neural Network Architectures, Deep Q-Network Algorithm, Policy Gradient Methods, Actor-\nCritic Algorithms \nTextbooks / References \n1.

Several industries are now built around the use of \ndata for decision making. Several research areas too, genomics and neuroscience being notable examples, are \nincreasingly focused on large-scale data generation rather than small-scale experimentation to generate initial \nhypotheses. This brings about a need for data analytics. This course will develop modern statistical tools and modelling \ntechniques through hands-on data analysis in a variety of application domains. \nThe course will illustrate the principles of hands-on data analytics through several case studies (6 such studies). On each \ntopic, we will introduce a scientific question and discuss why it should be addressed. Next, we will present the available \ndata, how it was collected, etc. We will then discuss models, provide analyses, and finally touch upon how to address \nthe scientific question using the analyses. \nWe will cover a subset of the following case studies: \n1. Astronomy: From Tycho Brahe's observations to the conclusion that Mars moves in an elliptical orbit \n2. Sports: The Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method for setting targets in shortened limited overs cricket matches \n3. COVID-19: Serological surveys \n4. Visual Neuroscience: Neural correlates predict search difficulty \n5. Genomics: Understanding the causes of cancer \n6. Genomics: The basis for red-green colour blindness \n7. Biology: Effects of smoking \n8. Networks: Community detection \nSyllabus \nData sets from astronomy, genomics, neuroscience, sports, biology, epidemiology, and networks will be analysed to \nanswer specific scientific questions. Statistical tools and modelling techniques will be introduced as needed to analyse \nthe data and eventually address the scientific question. Specific data sets will vary across offerings. Example topics are \nthe following: Tycho Brahe's data on Mars and Kepler's analysis of its orbit (astronomy), the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern \nmethod for setting targets in shortened limited overs cricket matches (cricket), retinoblastoma and causes of cancer \n(genomics), the basis for red-green colour blindness (genomics), serological surveys for COVID-19 (epidemiology), \neffects of smoking (biology), and community detection (networks) \nTextbooks / References \nComputer Age Statistical Inference by B.
