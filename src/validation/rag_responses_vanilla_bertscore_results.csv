I am on maternity leave. How can it impact my academics?,"If you are on maternity leave, it can have several impacts on your academics, but there are provisions in place to support you during this time:

1. **Extended Time for Thesis Submission**: You will be granted an additional year to submit your thesis or complete your program. This extension allows you to manage your academic responsibilities alongside your new parental duties.

2. **Additional Time for Comprehensive Examination**: If you have not completed your comprehensive examination before taking maternity leave, you will receive additional time equal to the duration of your approved maternity leave. This means you won't be penalized for the time you are away from your studies.

3. **Break in Studies**: Your maternity leave is considered a break in studies, which is permissible under university regulations. You are allowed a maximum of two semesters for breaks in studies, and your maternity leave will fall under this provision.

4. **Registration Fee**: Be aware that you may need to pay a registration fee for the break semesters. Ensure that you check the specific requirements related to this fee.

5. **Fellowship Consideration**: If you are receiving a fellowship, note that it will not be paid for the extended duration of your program due to maternity leave.

Overall, while maternity leave does impact your academic timeline, the university has policies in place to ensure that you are supported during this significant life event. Be sure to communicate with your sponsoring organization and academic advisor to ensure all necessary procedures are followed.","Women can avail a maternity leave as per Institute policy in case of maternity during the programme, in addition to the above.

How long is a student expected to work weekly for 8 project credits?,"To determine how long a student is expected to work weekly for 8 project credits, we need to look at the typical structure of project work as described.

Each course is typically for 4 credits, which involves 3 contact hours of live lectures and 1 hour of lab/tutorial per week. This suggests that for every 4 credits, students are expected to dedicate approximately 4 hours per week.

If we assume that project credits follow a similar structure, we can estimate the weekly workload for 8 project credits. Since 8 credits is double 4 credits, a student would likely need to work approximately double the hours.

Therefore, for 8 project credits, a student would be expected to work around:

- 4 credits = 4 hours/week
- 8 credits = 8 hours/week

So, a student is expected to work approximately **8 hours per week** for 8 project credits.",8 project credits roughly translate to 8 hours of weekly work.,0.8438
